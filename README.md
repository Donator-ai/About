Welcome to **Donator.ai**, an innovative new humanitarian crowdfunding platform launched by former staff from the United Nations, USAID and other aid organizations in response to sudden and disastrous USAID aid freeze. 

## Development

Donator and its AI lab are being initially developed through the [Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/About/blob/main/README.md) which links humanitarian organizations and tech companies interested in uses of large language models for good. Members help one another scope projects, deploy models, troubleshoot code and carry out basic testing.

We're building a brand new, cutting-edge crowdfunding platform adapted for the AI age that innovatively stores, reads, writes and traverses open data on humanitarian aid activities. 

## Get Involved

We're recruiting beta testers and volunteers to work on the project while we raise VC funding enabling us to move even faster. To join us or for VCs interested in seeing our pitch deck, email: team (at) humanitarianai.org
